**Design Pattern: Custom Oauth Login and Registration Integration**

**Intent:**
The Custom Oauth Login and Registration Integration design pattern is intended to provide a structured approach to building a user authentication system with registration and login options, including social platform integration (Google and GitHub) in a Laravel-based web application. The system ensures a seamless user experience with a custom login and registration form.

**Participants:**

1. **User:** Represents individuals who use the web application.
2. **Frontend:** The user interface for login, registration, and interaction with social login options.
3. **Backend:** The application logic that processes user authentication, registration, and user account management.
4. **Database:** Stores user account information and social platform credentials.
5. **OAuth Provider (Google and GitHub):** External services that facilitate user authentication through OAuth 2.0.
6. **Web Server:** Serves web pages and handles HTTP requests.
7. **Version Control (Git):** Manages source code and project history.
8. **Command Line Interface (Git Bash):** Used for command-line operations and interaction with Git.

**Components:**

1. **User Registration:**
   - Allows users to create new accounts with custom credentials.
   - Validates user inputs and stores account details in the database.

2. **User Login:**
   - Authenticates registered users using custom credentials.
   - Provides secure access to user accounts.

3. **Social Platform Integration:**
   - Offers Google and GitHub login options.
   - Redirects users to the respective OAuth providers for authentication.
   - Verifies user credentials with the OAuth providers.

4. **User Account Management:**
   - Manages user accounts and profiles.
   - Allows users to update account details, including email and password changes.

5. **Database Integration:**
   - Connects to the MySQL database to store user account data securely.

**Sample Flow:**

1. **User Registration:**
   - Users access the registration form.
   - They enter their details (name, email, password) and submit the form.
   - The backend validates the data and creates a new user account in the database.

2. **User Login:**
   - Registered users visit the login page.
   - They enter their credentials (email and password) and submit the form.
   - The backend verifies the credentials and grants access to the user's account.

3. **Social Platform Integration:**
   - Users have the option to log in with Google or GitHub.
   - Clicking the social login buttons redirects them to the respective OAuth providers.
   - After successful authentication, the OAuth provider sends user data back to the application.
   - The application verifies the data and logs the user in or registers a new user if needed.

**Benefits:**

- Customized user experience: Offers custom registration and login forms.
- Integration with popular social platforms: Allows users to log in with their existing Google or GitHub accounts.
- Data security: Safely stores user account information in a MySQL database.

**Considerations:**

- Data privacy: Ensure that user data is securely handled and that privacy policies are respected.
- Usability and accessibility: Create a user-friendly interface that accommodates users of all abilities.
- Performance: Optimize the application for speed and responsiveness.
